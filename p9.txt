You take a quick, cautious look at what’s around. The vast marsh that surrounds you is thick with\n
partially-congealed blood and various, unidentifiable bundles of viscera. You shift your weight,\n
as you take in the actions of your enemies.\n\n
While the two scaled-mammoths saddled with forest elves on your left are approaching with bloodlust\n
in their glossy eyes, the zorcs you chucked that hellboar at on your right flank are slowly, but\n
surely getting back up on their feet. Can’t say the same about the hellboar itself, as you already\n
smashed its skull very thoroughly. That’s a plus.\n\n
You look back to the elves, your keen eyes clearly identifying the boss, a fair distance\n
behind them. Now’s the proper time to strike.
