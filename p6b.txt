You decide to head to your sister’s room to check on her. The door to her room is open,\n
and she doesn’t appear to be there. You figure she’s probably already enjoying breakfast.\n
You head to the kitchen, but she’s not there either. Nervous, you call out her name and\n
briskly walk to the living room. Nothing. You run to check the bathroom. Nothing.\n
You begin to properly freak out and decide to check the front door.\n\n
“Boo!”\n\n
You hear a tiny voice yell out behind you, and all the panic that’s been bubbling up\n
inside you explodes briefly. You let out a sound of surprise, and quickly realize that\n
your sister is, in fact, behind you.\n\n
“Hehehe! Did I get you, Oppa?” She asks, as if the sound you’ve just made weren’t any indication.\n\n
You turn around, your heart still pounding in your head, only to see her, posing like\n
a cat ready to pounce. One hand like an outstretched paw, the other holding\n
a carton of banana milk.
