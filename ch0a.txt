It’s a bit later in the day you’ve been indirectly diagnosed with a sudden onset of permanent inferiority complex.\n
You sit at your desk resigned, but relaxed. You feel a lot better than usual, actually... well, at least as\n
far as your physical body is concerned. It makes sense, since the differences between hunter power ranks are huge,\n
it’s only natural that an E-rank would be way more resilient and capable than an ordinary human.\n\n
You ponder what to do now, since you still have most of the day free from work. Depending on how things go for you,\n
you might get a better one (even from the pool of non-hunter ones). You could also abandon your studies and focus\n
more on hunter work. This will increase your chances of getting more money quickly, which in turn, will allow you\n
to really help your mom. At least you hope it will play out that way. Getting your mom back is a goal you’re\n
determined to accomplish, eventually.
