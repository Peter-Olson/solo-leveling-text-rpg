You grin, admiring the spectacle, and decide it’s enough.\n\n 
Raising your hand, you disengage the skill and call back your blade. The hairs on the back\n
of your neck raise as you feel the mental link between the weapon and its wielder\n
hum with anticipation. The longsword instantly stops spinning and launches itself straight\n
at you, hilt-first. You wonder whether or not it will come back slowly enough to\n
earn you some style points.\n\n
Moments pass.\n\n
Your hand closes around the ornate hilt that invites itself back into your rough, but loving grip.\n\n
You land, raising a cloud of bloody mist around you.
