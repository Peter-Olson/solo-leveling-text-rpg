Inside, there are two other officials already seated. Once the lady who brought you here gets in,\n
the car quickly starts driving, and you try to gauge whether or not you should attempt at conversing\n
with any of them. They don’t initiate any interaction, other than looking at you, so you figure you’d\n
rather sit there in silent anticipation, rather than make it awkward.\n\n
You arrive at your destination and are quickly brought to a futuristic looking lab. You are told to place\n
your hands on a rather large metal sphere, and stay still. As the giant metal ball whirrs internally to\n
life and cycles between feeling like different kinds of static beneath your fingers, you can barely\n
contain yourself. The knot in your stomach seems bigger and heavier than during the whole ride here,\n
although you’re not sure whether it’s all your excitement or just the machine’s doing.
