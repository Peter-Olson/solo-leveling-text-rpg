Unwashed clothes litter the floor, you should probably take care of that.\n
Your backpack, gaping open, as if hungry for the notebooks you usually feed\n
it sits next to the desk. Some of the previously mentioned notebooks lay open\n
upon the desk, below a computer screen. You hear the hum of your PC and groan\n
in frustration. You really should remember to turn it off, before going to bed.\n
The electricity bill appears before your mind’s eye, longer than usual. You disapprove.\n\n
Considering that, you don’t really recall doing your homework the evening before,\n
or anything on the computer, for that matter. You must’ve been really out of it.\n\n
A glint from the opposite wall catches your eye, it’s your father’s shortsword.\n
One of the very few pieces of equipment he didn’t take with him into that dungeon\n
about… How long has it been now?\n\n
You take out your phone to look at the date. You know it’s tuesday, but the more\n
nuanced intricacies of the calendar elude you at the moment. Your stare glides lazily\n
past the system clock..\n\n
It reads “7:35”
