You angrily throw your fist on top of your alarm clock. Your hand bounces off, but the\n
clock still manages to make a chirping sound and fall off your desk. Jin-Ah appears in\n
the doorway with her hands on her hips, frowning disapprovingly at you. “Oppa!”\n
You lift your head and dazedly force a weak smile. “You have to get to school! No time to sleep!”\n
Jin-Ah grabs you by your arm and tries to pull you to your feet. You relent and grab your\n
backpack as Jin-Ah pushes you out the door.
