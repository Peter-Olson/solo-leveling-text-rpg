Fuck.\n\n
The thirty-minute bus ride to campus now seems more a punishment than inevitability.\n
You grab an egg-sandwich from the fridge and slam it shut in haste. Stuffing the sandwich\n
in your mouth you begin to quickly leave, making sure to give your sister a pinch\n
on the cheek on your way out.\n\n
“Ow! Meanie!” She squeals. More out of surprise, than actual pain. Serves her right,\n
you smirk, swiftly approaching the door. “Don’t forget your backpack, Oppa!”.\n
You stop, feeling slightly worse about pinching her. You give her a quick “Right..” and\n
dash back to your room to grab the backpack. Once that’s done, you’re out the door\n
as fast as your legs can carry you.
