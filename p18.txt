You take in your surroundings. You’re in the classroom, there’s no doubt about that.\n
Every set of eyes in the room is pointed towards you. Frantic whispers shoot through the\n
clean air, leaving you with the feeling that you’ve done something that will land you in trouble.\n
You focus your stare on the desk that served as your bed up until moments ago. It’s unrecognizable.\n
The cracked wood seems ripped apart and scorched where your hands rested just moments ago,\n
and the ever-present splinters are singed to a rich black. The metal frame is bent, as if a very\n
heavy weight has been pressing on it for quite some time.\n\n
“Sung Jin-Woo? Are you okay?” You can’t help but nod reflexively, still surveying the damage.\n
You’re glad you hadn’t laid out your notebook, as it’d be utterly ruined, beyond any hopes of saving\n
the pages upon pages of notes you have in there.\n\n
“What... happened?” You ask your professor hoarsely, surprised to hear your voice escape your lips.\n\n
“Um, Sung Jin-Woo..” She replies, visibly shaken. Her stern glare from before now gone completely,\n
replaced with a look of concern - \n\n
“I believe you’ve just had an awakening.”
