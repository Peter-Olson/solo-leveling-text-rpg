The irregular vibrations and sways of the bus make it hard to keep your eyes open.\n
It starts to feel like your tear ducts are producing glue. Despite your rush to get\n
to the bus stop, your ever-accumulating exhaustion catches up with you once again.\n
An abrupt change in momentum, as well as a few loud choice words uttered about the driver\n
that just violated a few traffic laws jolt you back into the world of the living.\n
“Keep in mind, an adventure awaits!”, you think to yourself. Masquerading your painfully\n
underwhelming life as an exciting adventure  gives you almost as much cynical pleasure as\n
daydreaming about being a hunter.\n\n
You don’t even register as you arrive at your destination. Leaving the bus and booking it\n
to your current classroom on this expansive campus is done by your body, separately from\n
your conscious mind. You’re fully on autopilot. This would make the ease with which you\n
ignore your professor’s stern glare seem almost nonchalant, if not for the sweat dripping\n
from your head, and your shortness of breath. You decide you’ll start exercising tomorrow.\n
It’s the fourth time this month you’ve made this particular oath with yourself.
