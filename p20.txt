You don’t even dare to imagine what an S-rank would mean.\n\n
Even if you don’t feel like an S-rank at the moment, you reason that there might be\n
quirks and layers to your power, that have yet to be teased out, properly utilized and\n
let loose. You remain hopefully optimistic, as if being anything other than that was\n
even possible for you today.\n\n
You decide not to alert your sister yet, she’ll be over the moon once you show her your\n
official papers, signaling the beginning of a new life for both of you.\n\n
Once the class is over there’s already a black-suit clad official waiting for you\n
in the hallway. She escorts you out of the campus and into a black, well-maintained SUV.
