You didn’t hear that right, just now, did you?\n\n
Did he say you were B-rank?\n\n
“So-sorry, wha-at?” You ask, stumbling over your words.\n\n
The scientist repeats himself.\n\n
You feel as if a wall of icy water slammed into you from above, enveloping your whole\n
body as your blood runs cold. Your ears start ringing, and you feel weak to your legs,\n
as you realise they’re shaking. You barely register the scientist saying something about\n
waiting for processing and him going to get your badge for you, and you watch him leave the room.
