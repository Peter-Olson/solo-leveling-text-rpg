A sigh escapes your lips as you ponder the fact you were just washing plates\n
and utensils at work. It seems like there is no escape from the dish soap smell\n
for you. You’re running on fumes - both physically and mentally.\n\n
If only…\n\n
If only you were given a real chance. If only you were a Hunter..\n
Things would be so different...\n\n
Strong. Revered. Successful. ..Wealthy. Hunters were at the top in those aspects.\n
The wealthiest and most popular in the whole of Korea, maybe even the entire world.\n\n
Fighting monsters and making millions. Sounds nice, doesn’t it?
