Along the way you inquire to her about the rest of the classes and your job. She responds that\n
you’re excused for today, your workplace has been already notified, and that you will receive a\n
fully paid day off. You smile. Perks of being a newly-minted hunter.\n\n
You’re not surprised that the school has an internal system to deal with freshly-awakened hunters,\n
you’ve managed to get in here on reasonably good grades, after all. You wouldn’t call the\n
institution prestigious, that’d be stretching it - but you certainly wouldn’t turn away someone\n
from here if you were looking to hire a well-mannered, educated worker.\n\n
The SUV’s door opening brings you back down from the cloud you were on, walking with the lady agent\n
and pondering your future. You get in, noting how the car very much fits the stereotype of what you\n
expected the Korean Hunters Association to show up in.
