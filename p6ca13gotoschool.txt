You stand up and grab your backpack and make your way to the door. Might as well try and\n
get there on time for once. As you swing into the kitchen, you see Jin-Ah sitting on a chair,\n
happily drinking some banana milk.\n\n
“Have a good day at school, Oppa!” she squeals out. You smile at her and\n
wave your hand as you step out the door.
