It takes you a couple of hours to get over how this all turned out. Jin-Ah is very supportive and\n
offers you words of encouragement. You start to work on getting a brighter outlook, and try to\n
treat your low rank as a pass to slightly better opportunities, compared to that of an ordinary person.\n\n
Your new license allows you to access the hunterjobs.com website. It’s not the official, government-regulated\n
portal, but it’s easier to navigate and it also offers opportunities that might suit a lower-rank hunter,\n
such as showing up to a gate just to fill the required number of participants.\n\n
You decide to shift your focus onto the opportunity which had admittedly been bestowed upon you,\n
regardless of how small. If it’s not much, you will just have to make up for it yourself, with hard work and dedication.
