You stare longingly at the computer screen. It seems like you were\n
playing a game last evening. You’d very much like to enjoy yourself for a bit,\n
and forget about your responsibilities. However, you know that sitting down\n
at the PC right now, would result in a whole-day marathon, as you feel you’d\n
lack the self control to stop in time for you to make it to the second class.\n\n
That’s a no, then.
