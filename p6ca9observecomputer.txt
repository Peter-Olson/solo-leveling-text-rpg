You consider yourself to be a serious gamer. Your rig is armed with\n
an Intel Core i5-8400, 16GB RAM, an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti GPU and an ergonomic,\n
illuminated mouse and mechanical keyboard setup. Only the best of the best\n
for all your gaming needs! Your thoughts are interrupted by the realization that,\n
if the worse comes to worst, you might have to sell your baby, just to keep the\n
roof over your and your sister’s heads. You preemptively shed a single tear.
