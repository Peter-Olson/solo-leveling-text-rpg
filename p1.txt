The sound of your sister giggling alerts you to the fact that there’s a world\n
outside the dishes you’re currently washing.\n\n
Jin-Ah looks up at you, a wide smile on her face. You always wonder where she\n
gets the energy to bounce around after a long day of school. Or the joyfulness.\n
You’re glad she’s here.\n\n
Sending her a half-smile, you strain to appear jolly yourself.\n
The long 8:00 to 1:30 school day sapped your spirits already. Then there was\n
work for another five and a half hours. Then looking for a better job.\n
And now chores. You’re utterly drained.\n\n
Her beaming smile gives you strength.
