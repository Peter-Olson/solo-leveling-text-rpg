Getting closer to the tall, hooded figure you notice its front guard is not advancing\n
towards you. A wise decision - the wide grin finally leaves your face, replaced with an\n
expression of focus. You remain cautious. You can’t really make out any features of the boss,\n
due to how absurdly long its hood is, although you think you saw a row of sharp teeth\n
give of a frustrated glint. Oh, you’re right - it’s scowling.\n\n
Good.\n\n
Your mood shifts however, as the figure begins raising its arms. You ready your longsword,\n
trying to prepare for anything that this caster will undoubtedly hail upon you.
