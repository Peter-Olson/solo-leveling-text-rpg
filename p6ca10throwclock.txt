You pick up your alarm clock and throw it against the wall. KA-THUNK. It harmlessly falls\n
to the ground, but you wince at the loud sound it makes slamming into the wall. You go to\n
lay back down, but Jin-Ah appears in the doorway with her hands on her hips, frowning disapprovingly\n
at you. “Oppa!” You lift your head and dazedly force a weak smile. “You have to get to school! No time to sleep!”\n
Jin-Ah grabs you by your arm and tries to pull you to your feet. You relent and grab your\n
backpack as Jin-Ah pushes you out the door.
