You try to be mad at her. You really do. She gave you quite a scare, and then\n
a startle to boot, but maybe that’s what you needed. You don’t feel a shred of\n
sleep on your eyelids, and skipping the morning coffee will let you save some\n
time, you reason, trying to look on the bright side of things.\n\n
You smile at Jin-Ah and head to the kitchen, giving her a pat on the head as\n
you pass, shaking your head. You ponder your breakfast options, approaching the\n
fridge, and then you hear your sister again.\n\n
“Oppa! Don’t you have class at 8:00 today? You’re going to be late!”\n\n
You hope she’s just trying to raise your blood pressure again, as you take\n
your phone out and steal a glance at the clock.\n\n
“7:46”
