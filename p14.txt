Huh.. guess it didn’t.\n\n
You turn around from the carnage after your bones are done rattling from the impact\n
you’ve landed with. Through the slightly red-tinted haze you spot the boss again,\n
a couple of mobs guarding him downed by the projectiles that your air-attack didn’t\n
like enough to swallow up. The grin doesn’t leave your face. Time begins to speed back up.\n\n
You turn around and deliver a shattering kick to one of the remaining hellboars that was\n
lucky enough to not be swept away by the wind and managed to get close. Its mangled body flies back,\n
smashing into two of its brethren, effectively stopping what remained of the pack with a chain-reaction.\n\n
Turning towards the boss, you approach slowly, letting your muscles rest. You don’t want to risk a strain, after all.
