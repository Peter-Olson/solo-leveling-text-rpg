Launching your blade at the advancing forces slightly before you finish casting the ability,\n
you observe as your longsword spins rapidly, end-to-end, gliding towards the oncoming barrage.\n
Just as you lose enough momentum to start falling back to the ground, you see its rotation rate\n
rise exponentially. The resulting gusts of wind swiftly form a tornado. Overwhelming wind\n
pressure manages to pry some of the charging boars from the ground level and fling them backwards,\n
at the bewildered zorcs, that just now started to realise their quickly approaching fate.\n\n
Just as you aimed for, most of the flying spears and arrows either disperse to the sides, or are\n
caught in the whirlwind created by your sword.\n\n
Still falling down, you see the storm of projectiles decimating the force that let them loose\n
in the first place. Your longsword comes along to play and cleaves a massive hole in the enemy\n
squadron right after the welcoming party finishes skewering most of the zorcs. Hellboars fly through\n
the raging air to smash the remaining survivors and splash into bloody messes against the\n
marsh’s surface not long after.
