The vibrations under your feet seem to grow in intensity. You glance back, disregarding\n
the dull thuds of falling cannon fodder.\n\n
There’s a pack of hellboars charging towards you, from where you’ve thrown one moments before.\n
The zorcs behind them have already managed to collect themselves and seem to be readying a\n
barrage of poison-coated spears and arrows. You allow them all to continue, taking a brief respite\n
to imagine the upcoming looks on their faces or ...well, snouts.\n\n
They’ve no clue what’s coming to them.\n\n
You explosively extend your leg muscles, taking high into the air in just an instant.\n
Nearing the apex of your jump you ready a skill appropriate for the occasion.\n\n
