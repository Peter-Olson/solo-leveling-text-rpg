Now that you’ve accepted the inevitable, getting a few more “z”s in doesn’t seem like\n
a bad idea. After all, you’re perpetually exhausted. Maybe one missed class could make\n
a difference in your overall frame-of-mind?\n\n
You make a decision to prioritize your mental health and well being, getting back under\n
the still-warm and ever-so comfy covers. You close your eyes, and before you can drink\n
in the sweet feeling of being irresponsible, you’re shaken awake by your little sister.\n\n
“OPPA! It’s almost 8 o’clock, you’re going to be SO late!” She does her best,\n
trying to pull you out of the sweet embrace of your bed.\n\n
Not feeling the tiniest bit more rested than you were before, you resign yourself\n
to what the messenger of fate,  Jin-Ah is urging you to do. She hands you your backpack,\n
now full of books and notes, and waves you out of the room, as you give her a pat on the head.\n
She smiles in approval, although still maintaining a posture of mocking anger.
