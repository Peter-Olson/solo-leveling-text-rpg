Even if they are vital for humanity, a random person can not simply become one of them.\n
Lady Luck has to smile upon you, perhaps as wide as your sister just did.\n
You need to be gifted the special abilities that make one a hunter. By pure chance.\n
An average person can’t even kill the weakest of monsters..\n\n
Your name is Sung Jin-Woo. You’re the son of Sung-Ilwhan and Park Gyunghae.\n\n
You are - regrettably - not a hunter.\n\n
More so, you seem to be the exact opposite of one.\n
A not-at-all impressive physique greets you in the mirror every day, paired with a sickly\n
pale complexion and a head of disheveled black hair. You’ve never really worked out,\n
or actually properly taken care of yourself, but you wouldn’t have to, were you one of the\n
lucky ones. A hunter. An embodiment of power and triumph.
