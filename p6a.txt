You stumble down into the kitchen to satiate your hunger. Did you get any supper yesterday?\n
You can’t seem to be able to recall. As you enter, you notice Jin-Ah is already there,\n
peppy as ever - enjoying some banana milk.\n\n
“Oppa! Don’t you have class at 8:00 today? You’re going to be late!”\n
You take out your phone and steal a glance at the clock. It shows 7:42.\n\n
Fuck.\n\n
The bus you usually take to the campus takes 30 minutes on average. Your adrenaline surges,\n
as you dash to the fridge to grab an egg-sandwich. Stuffing it in your mouth, you pat your\n
sister on the head humming “Have a good day, sis” through your nose as you rush to leave.\n\n
You have your hand on the door handle, as you hear Jin-Ah yell “Oppa! Your backpack!”.\n
You turn 180 degrees swiftly, and run back to your room\n
muttering “Stupid, stupid, stupid..” with you mouth still full. Grabbing you backpack\n
finally allows you to leave the house.
