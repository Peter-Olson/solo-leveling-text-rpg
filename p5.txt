Oh well. You have your own grand adventures planned for tomorrow. Another snooze-fest\n
of classes followed by work. Exciting as always.\n\n
You finish up the dishes and head to your room, making sure to say “goodnight” to your\n
sister on the way there. She chirps you a “goodnight” back.\n\n
Not caring about taking off your clothes you collapse onto the bed.\n
The mattress is so inviting... The fatigue of the entire day catches up with you once again,\n
and leads you to sleep with great ease.\n\n
You toss and turn in your bedsheets, haunted by the dreams of becoming Korea’s first\n
nerd Hunter. Slaying monsters with algebra, various assorted formulas and equations.\n\n
You feel sick.
