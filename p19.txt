The rest of the class is a blur. The fatigue that’s been accumulating in your body seems gone now.\n
News of your awakening is sure to spread quickly throughout the entire campus, as people are already\n
giving you weird looks, unsure of how to react, since they don’t even know your rank yet.\n\n
You shiver with anticipation. Eager to savor the flavor of the best day you’ve ever lived… You feel anxious,\n
waiting to know the proper extent of your newfound power.\n\n
Even a C-rank would be life-changing. All bills, mortgage, groceries - instantly taken care of.\n
B-rank would put you on the radar of many guilds, and practically guarantee you a steady income,\n
enough to live *very* comfortably and make progress with getting your mom back.. A-rank.. this would make you\n
a POI for the most prestigious guilds in the whole country. You’d be able to quickly amass a small fortune,\n
enough to pay for mom’s treatments many times over...
