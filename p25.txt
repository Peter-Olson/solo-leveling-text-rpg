This has to be a mistake, right?\n\n
You decide there’s no way that’s what he actually said. Driven by desperation you approach the\n
terminal, its screen facing away from you. You’re probably not supposed to go there, but no one\n
is here to stop you. You take a close look at the screen.\n\n
At its edges, there’s a lot of weird-looking lists, progress bars (all filled), and some diagrams,\n
all displaying values that seem to be worryingly low. What immediately grabs your attention,\n
however - is a very long sequence of numbers placed right in the middle.\n\n
“It’s a lot of zeroes..” you think to yourself.\n\n
And all of them are on the left in the sequence.
