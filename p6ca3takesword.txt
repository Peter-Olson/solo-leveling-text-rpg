You feel a sudden urge to take the sword from its hooks. You’re not sure why,\n
maybe the weird dreams of the math-hunter life are still bouncing around in your brain.\n
Either way - you know it’s not exactly a stellar idea. You have no use for a sword.\n
It serves more as a reminder of your father, a memento. Besides, coming to school\n
with it would just be asking for trouble. You might lose or damage it, and that doesn’t\n
appeal to you at all. You abandon that line of thinking.
