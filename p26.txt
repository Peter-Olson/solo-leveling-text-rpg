You go numb. Right under the center display there’s a smaller pop-up window, that clearly reads “E-rank”.\n\n
Your hopes are crushed. Dreams - shattered. Of every possible outcome your newfound “power level” places\n
you at E-rank. The gutter. The very bottom.\n\n
You so desperately wish to wake up and realize you’ve been having a rather bad dream, but no.\n
This appears to be how it is. The reality. Harsh. Cold. Unmoving. Final. Another thing your father\n
once said plays out in your head, a distant memory:\n\n
“Always be careful, when aiming for the top, son.” He once said. “Don’t lose sight of what’s below\n
and on either side of you. It might come to circumstances outside of your control, that you won’t reach\n
your goal, and instead tumble down. And the higher you are, the greater your fall will be.”
