You take a spare second or two to carefully observe the sword mounted on your wall.\n
It looks simple, despite having an ornate handle adorned with various jewels.\n
The blade seems unnaturally sharp, almost sharp enough to slice your eyeballs open,\n
just by looking at it. You absent-mindedly reach towards the blade, but stop, once\n
you feel the heat that always emanates from it. That’s right. Enchanted weapons.\n
You always figured a hunter with the right tools is better than one without.\n
Recalling your father’s words, you also consider, that one should be able to stand\n
their ground armed only in their own strengths and skills, not to rely too much on tools\n
and gimmicks. The sun rays glimmer approvingly in one of the smaller gemstones\n
fitted at the base of the blade.
