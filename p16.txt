Eerie tendrils of dark energy extend from its sleeves, where the hands should be.\n
You grimly realize you can’t see them clearly, due to a quickly overtaking darkness.\n
The air around you gets heavy, reeking of rot. You’re having difficulty getting it into your lungs.\n\n
The creature grins, seeing you struggle and lose composure.\n\n
It raises one of its cloaked appendages higher, and a stingingly bright, orange glow\n
starts consuming your field of view, seemingly in synergy with the darkness.\n
You can’t focus. You can’t see the mobs.\n\n
“Goyohan Jeonsa!” You attempt to gather your energy, but nothing comes forth.\n
The air seems dense and is sizzling in contact with your skin. The taste of metal\n
makes your mouth fill with bile, and you clench your teeth, still unable to properly fill your lungs.
