You know your strength is there, you can feel it, but it almost seems to weigh you down.\n
You hear cackling. Heat is washing over you, and you sweat profusely, falling to your knees.\n\n
What is happening?\n\n
The droplets of sweat splash against your desk, and the already crackling ground shatters\n
beneath your feet. “Sung Jin-Woo!”\n\n
Who said that?\n\n
Was it the boss?\n\n
The voice echoes again. The darkness surrounding you flashes out of existence\n
as you open your eyes to be greeted by a worried expression on the face of your professor.\n\n
Miss Chan-Ri?
