Jin-Ah really keeps you going. The funds your mom had stashed are running low,\n
and it doesn’t seem like she’ll be waking up anytime soon, so it’s up to you to\n
keep the lights on and provide for your sister and yourself.\n\n
You remember the mortgage is due soon. You’re not pleased.\n\n
“Hey, Oppa! Don’t forget to breathe out!” You realize you’ve been holding your\n
breath for a while. Jin-Ah playfully shakes you out of the web of worries you’ve\n
found yourself trapped in yet again.\n\n
The half-smile on your face widens, your dreary expression fades. You give your\n
sister a small, but honest laugh, and she skips away satisfied.\n\n
You go back to scrubbing dishes.
