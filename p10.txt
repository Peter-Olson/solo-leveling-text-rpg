You bellow with unnatural force and loudness, as you activate “Titan’s roar”. Your muscles tighten up,\n
blood starts boiling almost immediately, and you see the world around you slow down, as everything\n
sharply rises in contrast.\n\n
Your eyes flash a menacing red and the approaching enemies stop in their tracks for a brief\n
moment, clearly frightened by your display of sheer power.\n\n
That’s all the time you need.\n\n
In an instant, you’re already at the feet of the left squadron, your full momentum put\n
into a sliding slice. Your longsword cuts through the scales on the mammoths’ ankles like butter,\n
and you’re already prepared for the falling elves, as the towering beasts fall to the side. Your blade\n
separates the small heads of falling enemies from their torsos with a whirl before they hit the ground.
