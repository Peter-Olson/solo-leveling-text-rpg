You vaguely remember these words being followed by a brief talk about the importance of standing back up,\n
when life gets you down, but that doesn’t really register with you at the moment. These words however,\n
they seem to ring true more than they ever had, or even could.\n\n
You’re lost in thought when receiving your badge and license. You try to ignore the stares from various\n
people around you. The curious, the vaguely mocking, the sympathetic. E-rank is the lowest possible one\n
can get. While it’s true that even the lowest rank hunter can get some better jobs, gather up magic cores,\n
maybe even items - the path to real success is all but open for them. No recruiter worth their salt in any\n
self-respecting guild will give you much more than a cursory glance, and even if it somehow comes to it,\n
you’ll probably be relegated to an easier, less important and less paying job. You could also get a normal\n
construction job, but you really don’t like that thought, since from what you’ve heard - they tend to really underpay hunters.
